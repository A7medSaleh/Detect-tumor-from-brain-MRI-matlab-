This code reads MRI brain scans (.mha file) on matlab with a very clear GUI that can show all the 3D scans in very good way another option is a direct image file, then it process MRI brain images to detect tumor if exist or not if it does exist then by using machine learning this tumour can be classified as benign or malignant.

Image processing includes image segmentation and other image enhancments and Machine learning includes SVM model also the project has a training set included used in building the model

The code is implemented in a GUI (user friendly) to facilitate using the program with a 3D model for the brain for best visibility.
